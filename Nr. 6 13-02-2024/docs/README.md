# Bedtime story generator 2.0 + OpenAI ðŸŒŸ
 In this workshop, we will continue on the Flutter application that we developed last time. Instead of generating word pairs, we will connect to OpenAI's API and generate bedtime stories. 

## Recap of last workshop
We followed this tutorial: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node
We made a word generator for Chrome.
If you didn't attend the last Codelicious workshop, we recommend you to clone Marina's code using this git command, and start from there:

## This workshop

### Step 1: Sign in or create account in OpenAI
[platform.openai.com/login](https://platform.openai.com/login)
Select chat gpt 3.5, as it is much cheaper, and we don't need a fancy one.

### Step 2: Generate API keys
In order to authenticate us and use the API, we need to have a bearer key.
Generate your key here, and call it f ex "Bedtime story": https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node

### Step 3: Send a request to the API when user clicks "Generate"
Copy this code snippet, and change the OPEN_API_KEY to your own.

```
String OPENAI_API_KEY =
      'Bearer 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';
  final dio = Dio();

  Future<ChatCompletion> getOpen() async {
    final response = await dio.post(
      'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
      data: {
        'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        'messages': [
          {
            'role': 'system',
            'content':
                'You are a poetic assistant, skilled in explaining complex programming concepts with creative flair.'
          },
          {
            'role': 'user',
            'content':
                'Compose a poem that explains the concept of recursion in programming.'
          }
        ]
      },
      options: Options(
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': OPENAI_API_KEY,
        },
      ),
    );
    Map<String, dynamic> map = response.data;
    ChatCompletion chatCompletion = ChatCompletion.fromJson(map);
    return chatCompletion;
  }

```
