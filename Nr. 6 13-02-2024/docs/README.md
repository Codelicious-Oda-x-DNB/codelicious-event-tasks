# Bedtime story generator 2.0 + OpenAI ðŸŒŸ
 In this workshop, we will continue on the Flutter application that we developed last time. Instead of generating word pairs, we will connect to OpenAI's API and generate bedtime stories. 

## Recap of last workshop
We followed [this tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node), where we made a word generator for Chrome.
If you didn't attend the last Codelicious workshop, we recommend you to clone this repo and use [Marina's code from workshop nr 5](https://github.com/Codelicious-Oda-x-DNB/codelicious-event-tasks/tree/main/Nr.%205%2014-11-2023/marina-flutter_bedtime_story_generator) as a base.

## This workshop

#### Step 1: Sign in or create account in OpenAI
[platform.openai.com/login](https://platform.openai.com/login)
Select chat gpt 3.5, as it is much cheaper, and we don't need a fancy one.

#### Step 2: Generate API keys
We need to include a key to authenticate us when using the API.
Generate your key here, by clicking "+ Create new secret key": [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

#### Step 3: Add the Dio package to your Flutter project
We will use Dio to send http-requests to the API: https://pub.dev/packages/dio
Open up a terminal in the project in VS Code, and paste in the following command to install Dio:
```
flutter pub add dio
```


#### Step 4: Send a request to the API when user clicks "Generate"
Copy this code snippet, and change the OPEN_API_KEY to your own.

```
String OPENAI_API_KEY =
      'Bearer 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';
  final dio = Dio();

  Future<ChatCompletion> getOpen() async {
    final response = await dio.post(
      'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
      data: {
        'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        'messages': [
          {
            'role': 'system',
            'content':
                'You are a poetic assistant, skilled in explaining complex programming concepts with creative flair.'
          },
          {
            'role': 'user',
            'content':
                'Compose a poem that explains the concept of recursion in programming.'
          }
        ]
      },
      options: Options(
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': OPENAI_API_KEY,
        },
      ),
    );
    return response.data;
  }

```
