# night_time_story

This application is created using Workshop part 1 as a base: [amanda-bedtime-story-generator-part-1](https://github.com/Codelicious-Oda-x-DNB/codelicious-event-tasks/tree/main/Nr.%205%2014-11-2023/amanda-bedtime-story-generator.)

## The application

## Structure
I have created a folder structure to keep the project nice and clean.
You will find the application pages under /pages.
You will find all self made UI-components under /widgets.
You will find the call to OpenAI's API and other functions in the file main.dart.
