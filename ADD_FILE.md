- In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. 

- Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the main branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.
